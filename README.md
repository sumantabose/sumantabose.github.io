Hey!

This is the repository for my website [https://sumantabose.me/](https://sumantabose.me/) â€“ powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/). The hugo source files are contained in the [source](https://github.com/sumantabose/source) repository.

If you'd like to replicate my website for your personal use, follow the 3 simple steps below.

1. Download the master branch archive of the source repository from https://github.com/sumantabose/source/archive/master.zip
2. [`hugo server`](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/) to render the website locally at http://localhost:1313/
3. [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo/) to build the website in the directory `public/`

To learn more about Hugo read the [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

Cheers,<br>
[Sumanta](https://sumantabose.me/)
