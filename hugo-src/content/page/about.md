I am a Senior Research Engineer in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx) at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx). I work on full-stack [distributed ledger technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) system research, with specialization in [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). Currently, I’m developing our group’s in-house application agnostic blockchain platform. I also have working experience with [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum), [Corda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R3_(company)#Corda) and [Hyperledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger) platforms. <!-- Our group is led by [Prof. Kwok-Yan Lam](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=KWOKYAN.LAM) and [Asst. Prof. Anupam Chattopadhyay](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ANUPAM). -->

Prior to this, I completed by [PhD](http://www.openthesis.org/document/view/603554_1.pdf) from the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](http://www.eee.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) at NTU Singapore. My research area for PhD was mathematical modeling and simulation of semiconductor quantum nanostructures such as [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot)/[wires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_wire)/[wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_well) and [nanoplatelets](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2011/faster-colloidal-fluorescence-emitters-nanoplatelets). <!-- I’ve also worked on algorithms in machine learning, robotics, embedded systems and image processing. In my bachelors, I have worked on free space optics, metamaterials, antennas, electromagnetics and digital communication system. Across the areas I’ve worked on, I’ve extensively used probability, statistics, linear algebra, numerical methods, etc. implementing them on various platforms/languages such as C, C++, Golang, Python, Fortran, R, Matlab to name some. My publications are enlisted [here](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=7ISycOUAAAAJ&hl=en). -->

<!-- Before my PhD, I graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) from the [Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ece/) in [National Institute of Technology Trichy, India](https://www.nitt.edu/) with First Class honours in 2013.

Other than research, I am interested in travelling as a backpacker, reading, non-academic writing and film-making. Currently I am writing a fiction novel and a travellogue. As a student leader, I’ve also served as the Lead Curator of [TEDxNTU](https://www.facebook.com/TEDxNTU/), which is the TED chapter of NTU Singapore.
